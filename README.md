# Disclaimer
<b>THIS GAME IS SATIRE</b>
I am in no way with any school, buisness, etc on this. This is all me and my own persional code, jokes, etc.
Do not assume that it shares the values of others I may be associated with, because most likely it doesn't.

# This is immoral! >:(
So is the genocide of animals. Why don't you put down that cheeseburger?

# This is great!
You're a sick and immoral person for thinking that.

# Features
- VGA Graphics!
- Optimized assembly so fast and small!
- 32 bits of awesomeness!
- Dialog that took more than two minutes to type in leafpad!
